there are many differences between the ArrayList and LinkedList classes

1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
1)LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.

2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the other elements are shifted in memory.

3) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
3)LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

4) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.
4)The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.

5)ArrayList and LinkedList both implement the List interface and maintain insertion order. Both are non-synchronized classes.
